# Change Management Process

This section outlines the change management process for updating and maintaining the Data Exchange Framework Schema. Any modifications to the schema, including additions, deletions, or updates, must follow the workflow outlined below to ensure that all stakeholders are informed and have a chance to review and provide feedback.

## Change Request Workflow

Below is the visual representation of the schema change approval process:

### Steps in the Workflow:

1. **Member Request Change:**
   - Any member of the working group can initiate a change request by submitting a proposal.

2. **Chair/Co-chair Reviews:**
   - The chair or co-chair of the working group will review the request to ensure it aligns with the schemaâ€™s objectives and goals.

3. **Chair/Co-chair Decision:**
   - A decision is made on whether the change requires immediate application, member voting, or further discussion.

4. **Apply Changes Immediately:**
   - If the change is minor and non-controversial, it is applied immediately.

5. **Seek Members Voting:**
   - For significant changes, the chair/co-chair will initiate a voting process among the members.

6. **Invite Members for Discussion:**
   - If more discussion is needed, members are invited to participate in a review session.

7. **Apply the Changes:**
   - Once consensus is reached or voting is complete, the changes are applied to the schema.

8. **Inform Members and Publish:**
   - All members are informed about the updates, and the changes are published on the website.

## Additional Considerations

- **Documentation Updates:**
  Each change must be accompanied by a corresponding update to the documentation to ensure clarity and consistency.

- **Versioning:**
  Major changes will result in a new schema version being published. Minor changes will be recorded in a change log.
