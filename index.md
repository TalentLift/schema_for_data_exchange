    This page represents the collective efforts of a dedicated working group made up of partner organizations, including UNHCR, HIAS, Skillab, and Talent Beyond Boundaries, working together to create, maintain, and promote a standard data schema for skills-based complementary pathways.

    The framework developed is the result of shared expertise and collaboration, aiming to provide a key technical resource for stakeholders involved in supporting skilled immigration pathways for displaced individuals. This data exchange framework offers a comprehensive and reliable roadmap, enabling organizations to engage confidently in this space without needing to invest heavily in independent research or reinventing technical requirements.
