  This page is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote a standard data schema to be used in data exchange for the purposes of skills-based complementary pathways.
</p>
<p>
  We imagine a future where the framework developed can be used as a key technical resource to precisely identify what fields and data are critical to supporting skilled immigration as a complementary pathway. Creating a data exchange framework will offer a clear technical roadmap for interested stakeholders and will enable interested organizations to engage in the space without having to invest resources into research or guessing the technical requirements.
