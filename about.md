  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">About</h2>
  <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">
    The Data Exchange Framework is a collaborative effort led by a dedicated working group composed of partners including UNHCR, HIAS, Skillab, Talent Beyond Boundaries, and many other organizations. Our shared mission is to develop and promote a standard data schema for collecting and managing data related to skills-based complementary pathways.
  </p>

  <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">
    This standardized schema is designed to support the global effort of connecting displaced communities and refugees to meaningful employment and skilled immigration opportunities. By creating a common framework, we aim to streamline data exchange, reduce fragmentation, and improve the efficiency of data sharing across different stakeholdersâ€”ultimately enabling better outcomes for displaced individuals.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8">Our Vision</h3>
  <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">
    We envision a future where the Data Exchange Framework becomes a cornerstone for organizations involved in skills-based complementary pathways. This framework will serve as a key technical resource for precisely identifying critical fields and data required to support skilled immigration, enabling organizations to engage confidently in this space without the burden of building custom solutions from scratch.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8">How It All Started</h3>
  <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">
    The working group was established in early 2024 in response to challenges identified during a series of discovery interviews with partners in the Latin America and Caribbean regions. We found that many organizations used different systems and standards for recording candidate data, which led to inefficiencies and integration difficulties. To address these challenges, we proposed the creation of a shared technical framework that all stakeholders could adopt, simplifying data exchange and creating a more cohesive system.
